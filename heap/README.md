Heap implementation
-------------------

This is an implementation of a heap. It can be a max-heap or a min-heap. Elements can be inserted one by one or come from a vector. The test uses some C++11 features such as lambda function and new initializers. compile and run it this way:

    $ g++ -std=c++0x -o heap heap.cpp
    $ ./heap
