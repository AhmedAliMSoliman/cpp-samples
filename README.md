C++ samples
-----------

This repository contains various samples of C++ code that illustrate specific algorithms or C++ techniques. I wrote them as I was practicing for job interviews and also learning and experimenting with C++11.

For now, it includes:

* codility: Solutions from programming tests from http://codility.com
* dist: Mirror the distribution of samples of an input stream.
* edit: Edit distance (also called Levenshtein distance) between two sequences.
* heap: Heap implementation.
